# Final Create Task

## Project Plan

### To-Do List
- [X] Pass search term to program via command line or pop-up input.
- [X] Beautiful soup to parse the prices.
- [X] Output in either csv or json.
- [ ] Scrape links to the items and pictures of them.


### Future Posibilites
Beyond the Ap test I may develop this into a full scaled project capable of scraping multiple sites.
    > This seems like a good way to get better at Python, and Web Scraping/HTML understanding.
